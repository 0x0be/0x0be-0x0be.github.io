      <description>Every now and then I pick up my Ibanez 350DXZ and play some trash metal guitar solos.
Not having a &amp;ldquo;good ear&amp;rdquo; (only excellent taste in music), I always find it helpful to slow down the tracks to better understand what notes are being hit.

      <description>Summary On December 19, 2022 malware researcher known as StopMalvertisin twitted about a possible APT29 attack.
The spear-phishing campaign targets SberAuto, a Russian online car trading platform associated with the state-owned banking and financial services company Sberbank.
The analyzed attack displayed similar TTPs commonly attributed to APT29 (aka Cozy Bear), even though it is unclear why a Russian-backed hacking group should be targeting a domestic web service.
Technical Analysis Initial Stage The first stage of this attack is represented by an ISO file (0b32bd907072d95223e5eb2dc5e3d9e0) named &amp;ldquo;Алкоголь_2023_zip.</description>
